## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Full-Stack Software Engineer with over 2 years of experience working in startup environments. I specialize in building robust and scalable backend systems, including RESTful APIs and database integrations, as well as developing secure and high-performance frontend applications...[Full bio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/washingtone-otieno-1157bb198/)

My tech stack includes Node.js, Express, Python (Flask), Java (Spring Boot), React.js, React Native, and AngularJS. 

My experience in the startup ecosystem has been both rewarding and challenging, offering rapid growth opportunities, cross-functional collaboration, and the chance to wear multiple hats. It has sharpened my ability to adapt quickly, deliver under pressure, and build scalable solutions from the ground upâ€”often with limited resources and tight timelines.
